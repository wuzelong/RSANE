**Fig. 1**: The influence of outliers and heterogeneous information on attribute network embedding. In an attribute network containing three communities, nodes are visually differentiated with blue, green and red dots, respectively. The lines connecting these nodes delineate the network structure, with the distribution of node attributes displayed along the top and right margins. Upon introducing outlier nodes, depicted by purple dots with attribute distributions resembling those of normal nodes, the network structure experiences notable alterations. Moreover, the presence of heterogeneous topological and semantic information complicates the embedding representation learning process. For example, when nodes are topologically similar, semantic information can complement the differences between them. Conversely, when the topologies are dissimilar but the semantics are similar, it can disrupt the integration process. The 2-dimensional embedding generated by the state-of-the-art baseline is markedly impacted by outliers, leading to pronounced clustering of the three communities. In contrast, our method significantly mitigates the influence of outliers, owing to its robust capability to integrate heterogeneous information.

**Fig. 2**: The general framework of RSANE consists of three key components: heterogeneous information integration, joint embedding of structures and attributes, and adaptive outlier resistance. Given an attribute network $\mathcal{G}=(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{X})$ where $\mathbf{A}$ is the adjacency matrix and $\mathbf{X}$ is the attribute matrix, topological and semantic information are extracted by first-order proximity and cosine similarity respectively. The integrated weights $\mathbf{Q}$ sum up the topological and semantic information and multiply it by the high-order proximity. It derives three weights to constrain $\mathbf{H}$ in the embedding space, and $\hat{\mathbf{A}}$ and $\hat{\mathbf{X}}$ in the reconstruction space. Loss $\mathcal{L}\_{RSANE\}$ is calculated based on the outlier weights $\varphi_i$, and the outlier scores $\phi_i$ will be updated based on $\mathcal{L}_\{RSANE\}$.

> matplotlib==3.8.0<br>
numpy==2.1.3<br>
scikit_learn==1.5.2<br>
torch==2.5.1+cu121<br>
torch_geometric==2.6.1


## Dataset
In `./data/`, the `WebKB`,`Cora`, `CiteSeer`, `Amazon` and `Twitch` datasets are provided, along with the corresponding processed versions for link prediction and outlier detection.


## Training
Detailed training results and configs for node classification, link prediction, attribute prediction, outlier detection and network visualization are provided in `./Results.ipynb`.

Besides, it is also easy to run `./classification.py` directly to perform node classification, as is the case for the other graph learning tasks.
